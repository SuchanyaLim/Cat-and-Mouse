# Cat and Mouse

This repository contains the code for simulating a cat-and-mouse-chase in a 6-tile environment, based on reinforcement learning.

## List of Code

* `main.py`: contains code for testing the td-qlearning class.
* `simulation.py`: contains the implementation of the game state.
* `td_qlearning.py`: contains the class implementation of reinforcement learning, specifically passive temporal difference q-learning, to learn the optimal policy for mouse movement.

## Testing

```bash
python main.py
```
